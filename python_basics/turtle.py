'''Optional Assignment: Python Turtle
Try drawing a simple picture using the Python module Turtle.

Turtle is a Python drawing module for kids. It uses Python's built-in ability
to test GUI apps as you write the code. Even though it's for kids, you can 
do some complex drawing with it. Learning new technologies, languages, 
modules, plugins, and libraries is a very common practice for any programmer. 
When you learn about something new, make sure to try it, even if it's silly! 
Being curious is key to being a good developer!'''
